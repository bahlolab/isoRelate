Description: isoRelate detects genomic regions that are identical
	by descent (IBD) between pairs of isolates using a single nucleotide
	polymorphism (SNP) data. It is designed for haploid species and can 
	be used with multiclonal infections. isoRelate also includes a statistic
	that uses inferred IBD to identify genomic regions that have undergone recent positive
	selection, as well as a number of functions for plotting results.
